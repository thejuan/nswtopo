# Description

Add a UTM grid to the map with the *grid* command. Grid coordinates for northings and eastings are labelled along the map edges.

Used in a digital map, grid lines serve mostly to indicate scale, with one grid square traditionally representing a square kilometre on the ground. You can change the grid interval with the `--interval` option.
