# Description

The *layers* command displays a list of all the named layers currently installed for *nswtopo*.

Layers are installed separately to *nswtopo* itself:

```
$ gem install nswtopo-layers
```

Many layers are part of a higher collection. For example, adding *nsw/topographic* will include all the layers listed in the *nsw/topographic/\** hierarchy.
