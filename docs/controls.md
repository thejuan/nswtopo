# Description

Add rogaine controls to a map with the *controls* command. Collect your control waypoints in a GPX or KML file. *Google Earth* is useful for managing and naming your waypoints during course-setting.

# Naming
Any waypoint with a two- or three-digit name will be identified and marked as a control. Name a waypoint as *HH* or *ANC* to identify it as the hash house or all-night cafe. Suffix any control name with *W*, or have a separate waypoint so named, to identify it as a water drop.

# Styling
Controls are marked and labelled in the conventional style. You can change aspects of this style with the `--diameter`, `--colour` and `--font-size` options. The `--spot` option adds a centre spot for each control.
